# Time Series Prediction of BBCA Stock Prices using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting the time series of Bank Central Asia (BBCA) stock prices using the Linear Regression method. The dataset includes closing stock prices, and to enhance accuracy, a windowing approach with a size of 3 is applied. This allows the model to leverage patterns and relationships in the three previous observations to predict the next stock price. The project's goal is to optimize the time series prediction of BBCA to support investment decision-making.
